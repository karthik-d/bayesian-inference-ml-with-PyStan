Rename the models to "model.pkl" before executing with infer.py

REFERENCE

1) Beta(2,2) was used as the priors for skill1 and skill2
   The parameters were not discretized
   The AND deterministic factor was evaluated with 0.5 as the upper-biased threshold
	So was AddNoise

2) Beta(1000,1000) was used as the priors for skill1 and skill 2
	The parameters were not discretized
	The AND deterministic factor was evaliated with 0.5 as the upper-biased thereshold
		So was AddNoise

3) Beta(1,1) was used as the priors for skill1 and skill 2
	The parameters were not discretized
	The AND deterministic factor was evaliated with 0.5 as the upper-biased thereshold
		So was AddNoise

4) Here, the skill is taken as a real-valued parameter and classified into 0 or 1 using
    0.5 as the threshold. Results are pretty accurate with differences in the hundredth or thousandth places

5) In this model, the skill1 and skill2 were trated as distinct entities which was an incorrect assumption, given
    the fact that for question 3, both the skills play a role in determining its correctness

6) The final model, where P_skill1 and P_skill2 are the inferre posteriors, by completely treating them as discrete parameters
    In this particular instance, the model doesn't really learn anything except that skill1 and skill2 are 0.5 and most of the rest is
    manua calculation
